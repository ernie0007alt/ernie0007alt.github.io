      <h3>U.S. President Donald Trump talks about getting a 3rd term</h3>
        <p>"honestly a third term for me would be so bussin'. it would be so fire" said Donald Trump on Thursday. He has talked about a third term even during his first term. "i could only do it if it weren't for the ONE ABSOLUTELY STUPID george washington made to leave after only two terms." Only Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only president who has spent 3 terms in office. Trump is trying to find a 'similar mechanic' to get 3 terms in office. In a 1791 interview with George Washington, he stated "I might leave after 2 terms so I don't become too powerful. That would just be mean if I did." Trump, in return, said that was statement was 'an absolute lie' and that 'the 22nd amendment is the only thing that's not mandatory in my presidency.' The 22nd amendment is a <strong>policy</strong> that says "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice." The United States' president is still seeking a 'term 3.'</p>

      <h3>Monroe Doctrine DLC for Cities:Skylines 2 review</h3>
        <p>The Monroe Doctrine DLC (downloadable content) for the hit 2023 video game Cities:Skylines 2, a realistic city builder, launched yesterday. Us at Ernie News decided to do a review on it. Starting with the gameplay; once a player's city reaches 32100 Experience Points and unlocks the 'busy town' milestone, players can activate the Monroe Doctrine. Players might do this so that other towns that they have connections to, primarily ones on the East side (if any connections are on that side,) would not try to buy land from them. The Monroe Doctrine in real life says something like "we'll stay on your side, you stay on yours." If players want, they can violate the doctrine, which in a simlar way mimicks how the French conquest of Saint Pierre and Miquelon was seen as a violation of the Doctrine. A little easter egg is in the DLC-if players name their city "United States" and activate the doctrine, then citizens will use Chirper to say things about how the country is so strong and powerful because they defeated Great Britian, as well as the fact that they basically have the most <strong>strength</strong> out of any country in the Americas. Many reviewers, especially young Americans, don't know what to think about the addon, similar to how they view wars in the world. The DLC requires the Cities Skylines 2 base game, the Multiplayer DLC, and the Warfare DLC to be able to download and play it. Despite the launch of the addon, about half of the players in the Cities:Skylines fandom continue to play the original game.</p>

        <h3>Script for new JerryRigEverything video about the Louisiana Purchase leaked</h3>
          <p>It seems like JerryRigEverything, a famous YouTube influencer, isn't just doing Technology review videos anymore. He seems to also be reviewing geography. The script reads, "I had a couple of viewers ask me to do a teardown & durability test of the Louisiana Purchase. I decided to do it. Starting with the teardown, if you open the thing up, you can see Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Minnesota, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado are all in there. I think it would make sense if they put some Arctic territory in there because there's none of that with this device and it's basically an industry standard at this point, popularized by Russian smartphones. Lewis and Clark had previously explored the region, so you can see some of the monuments there. If you go into the operating system, you can see that there's the "Sacagawea" app used to translate between English and the native languages, a problem that Lewis & Clark faced and solved by hiring Sacagawea. In the photos app, you can see a video of Lewis & Clark interacting with the natives, and the natives are telling them about Beaverhead rock which lies along the further path. I think that interacting with the natives really helped with the expedition because they could know more about the area. I think that this device is revolutionary. It's gonna help the future settlers in the region, and I think it'll help the industry <strong>grow</strong>. The Like or Dislike app was introduced, and now users can rate the native tribes by their friendliness, alerting future users to know what tribes could help them if they move there, such as the Mandans. The weather app for this was updated as well, and now it features more forecasting about the area where the natives live, and it uses data from the Shoshone Weather Company." That is all that has been leaked of the script. Fans are excited for the new video.</p>

        <p>COLUMBUS, OH - Last midnight, Ohio governor Mike DeWine passed a law allowing anybody, regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or eye color to stay up all night to throw a block party at anybody's house.

      <h3>Terrified housewife eats own foot</h3>
        <p>DUBLIN, OH - At approximately 10:24 in the morning today, Maddie Bishop came home to a singular spider crawling across her sink. She then went into an extreme state of panic, causing Bishop to eat her own foot. When her husband, Owen Forloine, came home he said, "I didn't know there was a spider or anything. She didn't call me. I'm also suprised she ate her foot. How does one do that?" Bishop is soon to be sent to Lebanon Correctional Facility.</p>
